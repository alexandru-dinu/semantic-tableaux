the tree is built as follows:
check the status of current set of formulas (sp)

if the set is open or closed, don't construct further (leaf node), 
set closed status (sat <-> ~closed)

if the set contains non-atomic elements,
select such an element (m) from the non-atomic-only subset,
delete it from the original sp (-> sp'),
and recursively construct the rest of the tree, branching on m
(depending on what formula m is)
the status of current node is an and of the all child statuses

if sat, a possible assignment is the Open, Atomic set
